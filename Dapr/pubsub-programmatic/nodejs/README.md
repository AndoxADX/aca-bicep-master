# Dapr pub/sub with Container Apps

This sample Azure Resource Manager template deploys a Container App Environment and three Container Apps which interact with a pub/sub component.

### Log Analytics Workspace

A log Analytics workspace is deployed, which is required for the Container App Environment deployment.

### Container App Environment

The Container App Environment houses the Container Apps.

### Azure Service Bus Topic

An Azure Service Bus Topic is used as the Dapr pub-sub component to broker messages. You can use [any supported pub/sub](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub//). 

### Container Apps

- A Container App that publishes messages. This Container App uses an external Ingress controller so that you can publish a message via HTTP request.

- Two Container Apps that listen for and consume messages.


To demonstrate that the Publisher is able to send messages to the pub/sub broker and the Consumers are able to receive messages from the pub/sub broker, do the following:
1. Use a REST client to make the following request to the Publisher Container App (replacing *PublisherContainerAppName*.*FQDNSuffix* with your Container App's domain):

POST https://*PublisherContainerAppName*.*FQDNSuffix*/publish

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json

Body: {"mymessage1": "hello data"}

For example:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://publisher.<REPLACEWITHDEFAULTDOMAIN>.<REPLACEWITHREGION>.azurecontainerapps.io/publish -d "{\"mymessage1\": \"hello data\"}" 
```

2. Check the Log Analytics workspace to verify that the Consumer Container Apps received the message. For example:

```
let mymessage = "hello data";
ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL
| where ContainerAppName_s startswith "publisher" or ContainerAppName_s startswith "consumer1" or ContainerAppName_s startswith "consumer2"
| where Log_s contains mymessage
| project TimeGenerated, RevisionName_s, ContainerAppName_s, Log_s
```
